Doug Hoyte's "Production" version of macros from Let Over Lambda, including community updates; available from Quicklisp.

## News &amp; Updates
##### 16/11/2018

Reader macros for `defmacro!` (`#d{...}`), `defmacro/g!` (`#g{...}`), and `defun!` (`#n{}`) added by [Spenser Truex](https://github.com/equwal/). Intended for use only on SBCL which doesn't support them. Here are some example uses:
```
#g{listq (&rest list) 
    (mapcar #'(lambda (,g!x) (list 'quote ,g!x)) ',list)}
#d{square (o!x)
    `(* ,g!x ,g!x)}
#n{gensym () g!x}
```
Any escape character can be used `#d<code>`, `#d|code|`, etc. Watch out though since no other reader macros work inside of the code, incluing strings quoted with `""`. This could be added.


##### 3/19/2015

Add symbols for anaphoric macro internals, `IT`, `THIS`, and `SELF` to package exports for better end-user experience.  Will be available in April 2015 release of Quicklisp.

##### 8/14/2014

Issue with incompatible change to backquote syntax in SBCL 1.2.2 resolved; tested against and builds on SBCL 1.2.0-1 and 1.2.2.  Will be available in the August release of Quicklisp.

##### 12/18/2013

Now available in the December 2013 distribution of Quicklisp

## Usage

Make sure you have the latest Quicklisp distribution, then include it as a dependency in your system definition, or from the REPL evaluate `(ql:quickload "let-over-lambda")`.

```lisp
(ql:quickload "let-over-lambda")
(lol:flatten '((A . B) (C . D) (E . (F G H (I . J) . K))))
=> (A B C D E F G H I J K)
```

LET-OVER-LAMBDA now uses the `named-readtables` library instead of modifying the global readtable. To use LOL reader macros in your Lisp source files, you will have to add both `let-over-lambda` and `named-readtables` to your project dependencies, and the following line after your call to `in-package`, in every source file you wish to use LOL syntax:

```lisp
(named-readtables:in-readtable lol:lol-syntax)`
```
